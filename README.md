# Drone Simulator JavaFX Application

WORK IN PROGRESS

The application currently allows the user to add different kinds of Drones to an arena, which act in different ways. For example, one moves randomly, 
one hunts other drones, and one only moves if another drone is nearby.

### Current Features
- 3 Drone types with different movement and collision characteristics
- User placeable barriers

- Live information on Drones in arena

This is a work in progress, features I plan to implement:
- More types of Drones
- More user placeable obstacles
- Save/Load functionality
- A game mode in which the user controls a vehicle, and has to collect objects to gain points
