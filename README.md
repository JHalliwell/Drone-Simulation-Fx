# Drone Simulator JavaFX Application

This is a university project, all of which programmed by me. I used JavaFX and some CSS for styling. I learned a lot about creating a GUI application and using Object Oriented programming with the Java language. The specification was a drone simulator, however I chose a space theme, which is why there are some descrepancies in the naming.

This is an application that simulates different space ships in an arena which have different movement characteristics, with placeable wall's and blackholes's.

To use the application, simply download the SpaceSimulator zip file, and lauch the executable jar file 'droneSimulator'. The JAR file has to remain in the same folder as downloaded in order to run

### Features
- 3 Drone types with different movement and collision characteristics, as described in the 'About' section.
- User placeable barriers
- User placeable blackhole
- Live information on Drones in arena
- Save and load arena feature
